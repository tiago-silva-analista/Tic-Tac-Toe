# Welcome to "Tic-Tac-Toe" Project! 

Tic-tac-toe (American English), noughts and crosses (British English), or Xs and Os is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.

It is deployed on netlify and you can access the [final result here](https://tic-tac-toe-tiago.netlify.app/).

#ReactJS #CSS

## Structure

We are using **ReactJS** and simple **CSS** style to create the board. The proposal from this project is apply all concepts from React (Props, State and etc)

We are using a css condiction to show the winner combination (background green). We have improved the tic-tac-toe project implementing a reset game that reset all react state object.

We ave implemented a kind of history steps that the user can return to step 3 and perform a new combination.

We have used only two files at the moment: index.js and index.css in the filter we can structure it in a different file according to components.
